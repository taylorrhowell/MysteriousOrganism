This is a Codecademy project to practice JavaScript functions, arrays, objects, methods(both built-in and user created), and loops. With two helper functions and a factory function, I've created 30 simulations of a fictional organism called P. aequor, that will be used to study. The factory function features shorthand property name syntax and three methods. Please check the comments within main.js to learn more.
